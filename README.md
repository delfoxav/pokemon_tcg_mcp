## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12 or higher
- [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager (recommended)

### Method 1: Using UV (Recommended)

1. **Install UV** (if not already installed):
   ```powershell
   # On Windows (PowerShell)
   irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex
   ```

2. **Clone the repository**:
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/delfoxav/pokemon_tcg_mcp
   cd pokemon_tcg_mcp
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```powershell
   uv sync
   ```

### Method 2: Using pip

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/delfoxav/pokemon_tcg_mcp
   cd pokemon_tcg_mcp
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**:
   ```powershell
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Server

#### With UV:
```powershell
uv run --directory src server.py
```

#### With Python:
```powershell
cd src
python server.py
```

### MCP Client Configuration

Add the following configuration to your MCP client settings (e.g., `mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "pokemontcg": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["--directory", "C:\\path\\to\\pokemon_tcg_mcp\\src", "run", "server.py"],
      "env": {
        "TCGDX_LANGUAGE": "en" 
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `C:\\path\\to\\pokemon_tcg_mcp` with the actual path to your project directory.

## Usage Examples with LLMs

Once the MCP server is configured with your AI assistant, you can ask natural language questions about Pokemon TCG cards:

### Card Search Examples

**"Find all Charizard cards"**
The AI will use the `get_card_by_query` tool to search for cards containing "Charizard" in the name and return detailed information about each card including stats, abilities, and images.

**"Show me rare Fire-type Pokemon from the Base Set"**
The AI will search for cards matching these criteria and display comprehensive details about each card.

**"What are all the available Pokemon types?"**
The AI will call `get_available_types()` and list all Pokemon types like Fire, Water, Grass, etc.

### Set and Series Information

**"Tell me about the Base Set"**
The AI will use `get_set_by_id()` to retrieve detailed information about the Base Set including release date, card count, and all cards in the set.

**"What Pokemon sets are available?"**
The AI will call `get_available_sets()` and provide a comprehensive list of all available sets with their logos and basic information.

### Card Details

**"Get details for card swsh1-25"**
The AI will use `get_card_by_id()` to fetch complete information about the specific card including:
- Card image
- Stats (HP, attacks, abilities)
- Rarity and set information
- Artist and illustrator details

### Advanced Queries

**"Find all Pokemon with abilities from the latest regulation"**
The AI will construct appropriate queries to find Pokemon cards that have abilities from recent regulation marks.

**"Show me all trainer cards from Team Rocket series"**
The AI will search for trainer-type cards from the specified series and display their effects and artwork.

### Metadata Exploration

**"What rarities are available for Pokemon cards?"**
The AI will call `get_available_rarities()` and list all possible card rarities.

**"Show me all available illustrators"**
The AI will use `get_available_illustrators()` to display a list of all card artists and illustrators.
